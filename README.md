# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

It sounds like you’ve created a very interesting project! To help you create an effective README for your Gemini Clone app, I’ll incorporate the features you’ve mentioned (search bar, Gemini API, recent search functionality, responsive design, and more). Here’s a detailed example of what you can add to your README:

---

# Gemini Clone

**Description**  
Gemini Clone is a web application that allows users to search any topic using the Gemini API. The app displays search results based on the provided topic and includes a "recent search" function where users can view previously searched topics. The interface mimics the design of the Google Gemini web app with a clean, responsive layout, including a navigation bar and an option to add a new search query.

---

## Features

- **Search Bar**: Users can search for any topic, and the app fetches results via the Gemini API.
- **Recent Searches**: Displays a list of previously searched topics, allowing users to revisit past queries.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a menu with a button to add new chats or searches.
- **Modern Interface**: Clean and user-friendly UI, closely mirroring Google Gemini's design.

### Tips:

1. **Add more details** about the Gemini API you’re using, especially if it's custom or has specific limitations (rate limits, data sources).
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: You can mention how your app ensures a great user experience on mobile by adjusting layouts, elements, and user interactions.
3. **Demo link**: If you have a live demo hosted somewhere (e.g., on Netlify or Vercel), add that link for users to try it out directly.
